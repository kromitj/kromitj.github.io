<h1>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</h1>
<p>I learned how to bring elements closer together and put them farther apart. Padding allow me to put space between one element and another. Margins allow me to puff up an element. Margins and padding allowed me to make groups of elements look better by managing the space between them.</p>
<h1>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</h1>
<p>I learned about using relative to modify its static position, absolute position to modify its its position within a parent element and fixed to position the element relative to the view-port. It was fun once I became more confident in it, but there were a ton of mistakes and frustration at it not doing what I thought it should've done.</p>
<h1>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</h1>
<p>The easiest would be general formating and adding color to the site. The most difficult was getting navigation to work right and fine detail work of things like making blog text to look good, dealing with line spacing and font-size and stuff. It was also really easy to go into time-warps where you spend to much time on some tangent.</p>
<h1>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</h1>
<p>I learned how to make reusable classes that I could use to quickly change and make templates; it was fun trying to think that way, as opposed to dealing with every element one at a time. i can see how it can be really benifitial and powerful to create a library of classes that make formating easier</p>
