        <h3 class="blog-header">What Does The Zip Method Do?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">The <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html#method-i-zip" target="_blank">zip</a> method is a great one to use if you combine arrays together in a certain way. Like say you have three groups of freinds wanting to play eachother on 3-on-3 basketball, each team must have one player from each clique; using the zip meethod would be perfect for this situation. Let see this in code:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-ruby">
clique_one = ['adam y','mike','adam h']
clique_two = ['fatso','stinky','stretch']
clique_three = ['beyonce','kelly','michelle ']

new_teams = clique_one.zip(clique_two, clique_three)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "adam y",
        [1] "fatso",
        [2] "beyonce"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "mike",
        [1] "stinky",
        [2] "kelly"
    ],
    [2] [
        [0] "adam h",
        [1] "stretch",
        [2] "michelle "
    ]
]
        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">So we can see that the zip method is called on an Array and takes in the Arrays it wants to mix-up with as arguments. What happens if the arrays are of different lengths; I don't even know lets find out:</p>
             <pre><code class="language-ruby">
clique_one = ['sunny','cher']
clique_two = ['fatso','stinky','stretch']
clique_three = ['john','paul','ringo', 'george']

# what does it do if the array calling zip is shorter then its argument arrays?
new_teams = clique_one.zip(clique_two, clique_three)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "sunny",
        [1] "fatso",
        [2] "john"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "cher",
        [1] "stinky",
        [2] "paul"
    ]
]
# what does it do if the array calling zip is longer then its argument arrays?
new_teams = clique_three.zip(clique_one, clique_two)
[
    [0] [
        [0] "john",
        [1] "sunny",
        [2] "fatso"
    ],
    [1] [
        [0] "paul",
        [1] "cher",
        [2] "stinky"
    ],
    [2] [
        [0] "ringo",
        [1] nil,
        [2] "stretch"
    ],
    [3] [
        [0] "george",
        [1] nil,
        [2] nil
    ]
]
        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">When the Array calling zip is shorter then then its argument arrays you can see that that it stops when its pushed all the elements of the smaller array into the mixed-up arrays. And when the Array calling is longer it continues even when the smaller Arrays run out of elements to add. </p>

        <h3 class="blog-header">Lets Convert a 2d Array into a structured Hash</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">So we have an Array whos first index element consists of the header names for each data field and all the following indexes are data entries for the table. Our job is to convert this Array into Hash were every data entry(row) has correct keys for each value. Lets see this in action:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
data_table = [
  ['Guitar Name','Year Released','Famous Player'],
  ['Telecaster','1950','Andy Summers'],
  ['Stratocaster', '1954', 'Buddy Holly'],
  ['Les Paul', '1952', 'Jimmmy Paige'],
  ['Jazzmaster','1958','Elvis Costello']
]

def format_hash(data)
  formated_hash = []
  i = 1
  while i < data.length
    formated_array = data[0].zip(data[i])
    p formated_array
    formated_hash << Hash[formated_array]
    i += 1
  end
  formated_hash
end

[
    [0] {
          "Guitar Name" => "Telecaster",
        "Year Released" => "1950",
        "Famous Player" => "Andy Summers"
    },
    [1] {
          "Guitar Name" => "Stratocaster",
        "Year Released" => "1954",
        "Famous Player" => "Buddy Holly"
    },
    [2] {
          "Guitar Name" => "Les Paul",
        "Year Released" => "1952",
        "Famous Player" => "Jimmmy Paige"
    },
    [3] {
          "Guitar Name" => "Jazzmaster",
        "Year Released" => "1958",
        "Famous Player" => "Elvis Costello"
    }
]

        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">So we can see that the while loop iterates 4 times becuase there are four data entries in the array. You can also see that through each iteration the first element of the array, <em>data[0]</em> calles the zip method with <em>data[i]</em> as its argument, data[i]; This merges them into one array that look like this:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-ruby">
[["Guitar Name", "Telecaster"], ["Year Released", "1950"], ["Famous Player", "Andy Summers"]]

# So this is a 2-dimensional array with each first level element containing the key as its first element and the value as its second
# So how do you convert this into a hash? You ask, I ask as well, cuz this ishh is confusing; Lets see:

data_entry = [["Guitar Name", "Telecaster"], ["Year Released", "1950"], ["Famous Player", "Andy Summers"]]
Hash[data_entry]

{
      "Guitar Name" => "Telecaster",
    "Year Released" => "1950",
    "Famous Player" => "Andy Summers"
}
        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">The last part of this was a black-box to me when I implemented it and was confusing how just magically turned those Arrays into a perfectly formated Hash. The reason it works if is:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
Hash[ [ [key, value], ... ] ] â†’ new_hash
Hash[ [ ["a", 100], ["b", 200] ] ]   #=> {"a"=>100, "b"=>200}
# Our Example: 
[["Guitar Name", "Telecaster"], ["Year Released", "1950"], ["Famous Player", "Andy Summers"]] #=> { "Guitar Name" => "Telecaster",
 "Year Released" => "1950", "Famous Player" => "Andy Summers"}
        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">This is from the Ruby hash docs, and you can see that you can create a Hash by giving it a 2-dimensional Array whos inside Array elements have two elements; just like the 2-dimensional Array we past it in our problem. Isn't it nice when things come together so perfectly?</p>
