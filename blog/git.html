  <h1>Version Control</h1>
  <h2>WHY YOU SHOULD BE USING IT</h2>

    <h3>Let's figure out what it is.</h3>
    <p>
      Version control is a software system that tracks the changes made to a project and keeps a archivable back-log of the changes; It's like a high-tech, non-volitile, undo button. Version control allows you to go back in time and see the source of your project at that any particular time. This is helpful, because if you majorly screw-up your program one day and can't find the source of the error, you can use version control to revert to a previous stable version on the program.
