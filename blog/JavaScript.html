        <h3 class="blog-header">How Are Ruby and JavaScrip Different</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">This blog post is going to go over how Ruby and JavaScript handle OOP programing in different ways. The difference can seam really
        large when you go from Ruby to JavaScript, so I'm going to compare them against each other and you will see there differences but will also see that fundamentally they allow for very similar OOP principles, most importanly the concept of encapsulation of properties and methods and inheritance.
        </p>
        <h3 class="blog-header">In The Red corner, Ruby...</h3>
        <p class="blog-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Ruby</a> is object0-orientated programming language that handles classes in a very classical way; if you know java or c++ then the way manner in which Ruby handles inheritence and the decloration of classes will be easy to grasp. I will now declear a class in Ruby and create an instance of it:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Character
  def initialize(first, last, has_hat, shirt_color)
    @first_name = first
    @last_name = last
    @wears_hat = has_hat
    @shirt_color = shirt_color
  end
  def spew_info
    puts "This characters name is #{#first_name} #{@last_name}, and their shirt color is #{@shirt_color}."
  end
end # end of class definition


kyle = Character.new("Kyle", "Broflovski", true, "Orange")
kyle.spew_info 
=> This characters name is Kyle Broflovski, and their shirt color is Orange.

        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">Here we can see a class with a name of Character being declared with instance variables and one instance method. Now let's create another class that inherites from the Character class:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-ruby">
class Character < MainCharacter
  def initialize(first, last, has_hat, shirt_color, catch-phrase)
    super(first, last, has_hat, shirt_color)
    @catch_prase = catch_phrase
  end

  def say_catch_prase
    puts @catch_prase
  end  
end # end of class definition


kyle = MainCharacter.new("Kyle", "Broflovski", true, "Orange", "Oh my God, they killed Kenny!' 'You bastards!")
kyle.spew_info 
=> This characters name is Kyle Broflovski, and their shirt color is Orange.
kyle.say_catch_phrase
=> Oh my God, they killed Kenny!' 'You bastards!

        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">So here we can see that during the initialize method of MainCharacter that <em>super</em> calles the initialize method of Character, setting up all the inherited instance vars. Then it assignes a new instance variable and declears a new method called say_catch_phrase. This is all cool and neat, but how would we do this in JavaScript?</p>
        <h3 class="blog-header">In The Yellow Corner, JavaScript...</h3>
        <p class="blog-text"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> follows OOP principles, but to get technical it is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" target="_blank">Prototype-based</a> language, which I could try to explain, but I think that seeing it in action is a better way to understand this. We will now create the same Classes that we had in Ruby in JavaScript:</p>
         <pre><code class="language-javascript">
function Character(first, last, hasHat, shirtColor) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.wearsHat = hasHat;
  this.shirtColor = shirtColor;
  this.spewInfo = function() {
    console.log("This Characters name is " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", and their shirt color is " + this.shirtColor); 
  };
};

var kyle = new Character("Kyle", "Broflovski", true, "Orange");
kyle.spewInfo;
=> This characters name is Kyle Broflovski, and their shirt color is Orange.

        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">So here we can see the Javascript version and it looks weird, I know. But, what we have made is a constructor function. This gives us the functionality of a class, but here is where it gets interesting. With constructor functions you can add/remove attributes and methods at run-time, meaning after you've declared it; in Ruby you have to declare all attributes and methods in the class decloration. The ability to add/remove methods or attributes in JavaScript is due to the prototype-based part of the language; when you create an instance of a "class", we would say in JS, that you're actually cloning the prototype; if you had a clone machine and cloned an apple, the original apple would be prototype, clone would be the clone, and you would be free to modify the clone with out affecting the prototype. Here we will give an example of this.</p>
 <pre><code class="language-javascript">
 var kyle = new Character("Kyle", "Broflovski", true, "Orange");
kyle.spewInfo;
=> This characters name is Kyle Broflovski, and their shirt color is Orange.

kyle.spewRandomJibberish = function() {
  console.log("Hothagow othagold othagare yothagou?")
};
kyle.father = "Gerald";

kyle.spewRandomJibberish();
=> Hothagow othagold othagare yothagou?

kyle.father;
=> Gerald

        </code></pre>
        <p class="blog-text">This ability means that Javacript is alot less constrictive with how you choose to impliment OOP in your programs. It also gives a lot of ambiguity to how implement OOP in JavaScript, because of the way it seporates itself from the rigid class-based structure of other languages; I think JavaScript is super confusing because it seams like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Now let's create the Main Character "class" that inherits from Character:</p>
