        <h3 class="blog-header">Takin' Drugs TO Get Ahead</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">If you went to college then you either took "smart drugs" or knew people who did to cram for a final exam or just improve concentration. Given movies like Limitless and the whole bio-hacking movement, it's worth asking, if you could take a drug that would increase your concentration, resistance against brain-fry and improve brain function, would you take it? If the side effects were minimal and stigma against it was also minimal, would you buy a smart-drug on the black market if it meant performing better then colleges and getting promoted before them.

        <p class="blog-text">I remember reading about "Bulletproof Coffee". It was inspired by a drink that people high in the Himalayas drink; the drink consists of butter and tea. The Bulletproof version is: grass-feed cow butter, Coconut oil high in MTC(Medium-chain triglycerides) which supposably is like super food for your brain, and coffee. The drink averages about 460 calories and is like drinking olive oil. People swear by the drink, even celebrities like; Ed Sheerin and Jeremy Piven(is he really a celebrity). The person who invented the drink is Dave Asprey, and he is a software developer. I tried the bulletproof coffee for about a week but ultimately gave up. I later came across an article with Dave Asprey, but this time it was about his use of a drug meant for people narcolepsy; the drug is called Provigil, and it's being slanged as a grown-up Adderall. The side-effects though, include: headaches, nausea, back pain, burning or tingling skin, and more severely, rashes, hives, problems with breathing or swallowing, anxiety, depression and hallucinations; sounds nice. This is when I started doubt the claims made by Mr. Asprey and also worry about being in an environment where everybody is taking drugs in order function at a perceived high level. I started to picture David as the dude from Flowers for Algernon. Like something in his brain would change and then it would rapidly deteriorate.</p>

        <p class="blog-text">In conclusion, I just think that people shouldn't have to take drugs in order to stay competitive in the workplace. Theres no magic solution to "god-mode", and while I'm sure Provigil gives users a really zen like state of hyper-concentration and brain performance; I just think it's toxic to the community to endorse the practice.</p>
